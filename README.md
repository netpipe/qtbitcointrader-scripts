# qtbitcointrader-scripts
hft bot for high frequency trading - experimental

both scripts arnt functioning at the moment. possability of being freelanced to finish.

would like an indexer to keep track of profit with a database of purchase prices and available stock

buy low sell high is the basic operation
buy on the way up and sell on the way down before volumes increase ?

yobit seems to be a great place for trading. has minimum 20 dogecoin trading through api
